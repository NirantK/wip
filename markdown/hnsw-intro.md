# Introduction to HNSW

## Introduction

### A. Brief explanation of nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces

Nearest neighbor search is a fundamental computational task that finds application in a variety of fields, including machine learning, computer vision, and data mining, among others. Essentially, it involves identifying the data points in a dataset that are closest to a given query point, where 'closeness' is usually defined in terms of a distance metric like Euclidean distance.

This becomes a particularly challenging task in high-dimensional spaces due to the so-called "curse of dimensionality". As the dimensionality of a dataset increases, the volume of the space increases so fast that the available data become sparse, making it hard to identify which data points are nearest to a given query point. Furthermore, traditional exact nearest neighbor search methods can be computationally expensive, making them infeasible for high-dimensional data, especially when the dataset is large.

### B. Introduction to HNSW and its purpose

Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) is a solution designed to tackle the aforementioned problems associated with nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. HNSW is a graph-based data structure used for this task. It leverages the small-world phenomenon, which states that most nodes in a graph can be reached by a small number of hops. This phenomenon, widely observed in social networks and the internet, is exploited by HNSW to efficiently traverse the high-dimensional space.

HNSW builds a hierarchical graph by recursively partitioning the data space into smaller regions and connecting them with shortcuts to create a small-world network. This structure is highly efficient and memory-friendly, capable of handling large datasets with millions or billions of data points. Each node in this graph represents a data point, and edges between nodes represent the similarity or 'closeness' between them.

However, it's important to note that HNSW is an approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm. This means it does not guarantee finding the exact nearest neighbors but instead returns a set of candidates that are likely to be close to the query point. This trade-off between accuracy and speed is necessary for high-dimensional data.

Moreover, HNSW's design is parallelizable, meaning it can be run on multiple processors or nodes to expedite the search process, making it particularly useful for large-scale applications where the search time could be a bottleneck. By using a hierarchical structure to reduce the number of edges in the graph, and by pruning low-quality edges, HNSW efficiently reduces the search space while maintaining its utility and performance.

## II. The Concept Behind HNSW

### A. Explanation of the small-world phenomenon

The small-world phenomenon is a concept that originates from social networks, where it's observed that we are all, on average, approximately six connections away from any other person on the planet. This idea has been extrapolated to many different systems and is the cornerstone of network theory. The phenomenon suggests that, in a network, most nodes can be reached from every other node in a small number of hops or steps, despite the large total number of nodes present.

### B. How HNSW applies this principle

The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) approach applies the small-world phenomenon to the problem of nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. Instead of attempting to construct a complex Delaunay graph, where vertices close to each other are connected and no isolated vertex exists, HNSW constructs an approximation of this graph, termed an Navigable Small World (NSW) graph.

The creation of an NSW graph begins by inserting vertices one after another in a random order. Each new vertex is connected to a predefined number 'M' of the closest existing vertices in the graph. This process continues until all vertices are inserted, thereby creating a graph that exhibits the small-world phenomenon. This means that some connections built in the early stages of graph construction become long-range links, which can be traversed quickly during a search.

### C. The use of recursive partitioning in creating the hierarchical graph

The search process in an NSW graph is a simple greedy search method, where a search can be initiated from any vertex. The algorithm selects a friend vertex that is nearest to the query vector and moves towards that vertex. This process is repeated until it can no longer find any friend that is closer to the query vector than the current vertex.

Importantly, the algorithm only uses local information at each step and requires no prior global knowledge of the dimensionality or distribution of the data. This is a significant advantage of the HNSW and NSW methodologies, as they simplify the search process while still maintaining effective and efficient results.

The quality of the search can be improved by performing multiple searches with different random entry points. This process demonstrates the use of recursive partitioning in HNSW, as the search space is effectively partitioned and explored in a manner that is guided by the local connections within the graph.

## III. The Mechanics of HNSW

### A. The graph-based data structure of HNSW

The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm uses a unique graph-based data structure. The architecture is inherently hierarchical, with each level of the hierarchy representing a different set of nearest neighbors. The entire dataset is represented by the root node of the graph.

The hierarchy is built using a technique called recursive partitioning, which involves dividing the dataset into smaller subsets. Each subset consists of similar data points, with similarity measured using a specified distance metric. This results in a tree-like structure where the relationships between nodes are determined by their relative distances, and each level of the tree encapsulates a different partition of the data.

### B. Description of nodes and edges in the context of HNSW

In the context of HNSW, each node in the graph represents a data point in the dataset. This data point is typically described by a vector of features or attributes. Edges between nodes, on the other hand, represent the similarity or 'closeness' between data points. The degree of similarity is determined by a distance metric, typically based on the Euclidean distance or another measure of similarity.

For a graph to be navigable, every node must have edges, often referred to as 'friends' in this context. A node without edges would be unreachable, which would negate the purpose of having a navigable graph. However, it's important to note that having too many edges for a node can be resource-intensive, both in terms of memory storage required for these connections and the computational power needed during search operations.

### C. How similarity between data points is represented

Similarity between data points in HNSW is represented by the edges between nodes. These edges are formed based on a distance metric that quantifies the closeness between two data points. The shorter the edge (or the smaller the distance metric), the more similar the two data points are.

When a search query is initiated for a given query point, the HNSW algorithm begins traversing the graph, starting at the root node. It progresses down the hierarchy, moving from node to node based on the shortest edges, which represent the closest neighbors to the query point. This process continues until the algorithm identifies the nearest neighbors of the query point.

Thus, the graph structure of HNSW, along with its nodes and edges, facilitates an efficient and effective way to represent, store, and search for nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces.
