    "# Qdrant and Llama-Index: A new way to keep your Q&A systems up-to-date \n",
    "\n",
    "Ever found yourself frustrated with an answer engine that's stuck in the past? As our world rapidly evolves, the accuracy of information changes accordingly. Traditional models can become outdated, providing answers that were once accurate but are now obsolete. The cost of outdated knowledge can be high - misinforming users, impacting decision-making, and ultimately undermining trust in your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where Qdrant and Llama-Index come in, ensuring that answer engines stay relevant. These cutting-edge tools offer a fresh, timely perspective, ensuring your answer engine adapts to the relentless pace of information change.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will demonstrate **how to build an answer engine that stays up-to-the-minute**. \n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering Qdrant and Llama-Index, you can transform your applications from static knowledge repositories into dynamic, adaptable knowledge machines. Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or an AI enthusiast, join us on this learning journey - the future of answer engines is here, and it's time to embrace it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial covers setting up the necessary tools and API keys, loading documents, and adding postprocessors to improve the relevance of search results. The News Category Dataset v3 is used as an example dataset.\n",

We loaded a news dataset, created a Qdrant client, and loaded our data into a Llama-Index. We defined a recency postprocessor and a Cohere reranking postprocessor, and used these to create various query engines. We then queried these engines with various questions and compared their responses.\n",
