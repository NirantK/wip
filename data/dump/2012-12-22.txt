Review: MoMA PS1's Now Dig This! Art and Black Los Angeles, 1960-1980 under the category: CULTURE & ARTS
 The artists presented in Now Dig This! conjoin aesthetic concerns with cultural, ideological and political critique to produce artwork that, on the whole, is affecting and galvanizing. Kellie Jones' corralling of this work into a single exhibition is nothing short of a stroke of genius.
