We Have a Digital Baby under the category: PARENTING
 We have a digital baby who is growing up online, with a very public life lived on Facebook. We allow friends and strangers to peer into his fishbowl, savoring everything about him almost in real time. People he will never meet know his smiles and sadnesses, his flickering moods.
