The Power of Collective Voice under the category: EDUCATION
 Through the union, educators are raising our collective voice. Together with parents and students, educators are turning the tide.  Teaching is our heart. Our students are our soul. And the union is our spine. When educators raise their voice and their power, we can reclaim the promise of public education.
