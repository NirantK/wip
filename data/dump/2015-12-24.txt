The Gift under the category: IMPACT
 These interviews are yours to read and enjoy over time and they are here to be shared. My secret hope is that in doing so you may be encouraged or lulled into gifting all of us what comes easily to you. In many ways, I'm beginning to think it's the thing we all need most today. Thank you for another great year of reading and passing them on.
