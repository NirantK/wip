Laura McPhee: River of No Return under the category: CULTURE & ARTS
 Laura McPhee walked me through her exhibit, River of No Return, at the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art. We discussed her life and the show's twenty-three mural sized chromogenic prints she photographed over several years in the ranch land and wilderness of central Idaho.
