Bucket List? No Thanks. under the category: WELLNESS
 Maybe not having a list of dreams makes me a cynic. Maybe saying I only ever wanted to be a mother and an author makes me simple.  But maybe what it really means is that I know myself well and feel completely content with who I am, and where I am, today.
