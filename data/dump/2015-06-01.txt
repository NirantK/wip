 President after president has promised that the U.S. will compel foreign nations to meet labor standards established in free-trade agreements. They haven't. They probably can't. And American workers and politicians should stop buying it. The U.S. can sign trade agreements with countries after they stop murdering trade unionists and countenancing child labor.
