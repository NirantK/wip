The One Travel Resolution You Need to Make under the category: TRAVEL
 This year I've made only one travel resolution. And I do think that it's the most important one of all: Keep traveling. 
So I'm resolving to keep on traveling in 2016 and beyond, and I hope you do as well, for your own well-being and for the well-being of us all.
