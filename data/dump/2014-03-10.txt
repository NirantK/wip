'Are My Dads Gay?' under the category: PARENTING
 Last night my son, Javier, and I were driving in the car listening to Macklemore's song, "Same Love," which mentions that when the singer was a kid, he thought he might be gay. "Macklemore's gay!" Javier said, both matter-of-factly and with great joy.
