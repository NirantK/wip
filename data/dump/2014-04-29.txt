ONE ON ONE: Lily Cole on The Gift Economy under the category: WORLDPOST
 At just 26, Lily has already carved out an incredibly successful career as a model and actress and graduated from Cambridge University. On top of that, she's just launched Impossible.com, a website and app that encourages people to do things for others for free. It's based on the idea of a gift economy, a mode of exchange where things are not sold but given. The site encourages people to post wishes of things that they want or need help with, and offer what they can give. Lily says she hopes the site creates a community that fosters giving and receiving. "I called it Impossible, because I thought that a lot of people would say that it was impossible," says Lily. "It's an incredibly utopian proposition and I quite liked facing the cynics from the beginning with the name."
