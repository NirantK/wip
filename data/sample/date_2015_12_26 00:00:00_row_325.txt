The Next Climate Crusader in the White House
If our country is truly going to be a leader when it comes to advancing solutions, we will need to build on prior executive actions and have the courage to take them a step further. To do this, we will need a powerful voice in the White House with the experience and leadership to keep moving us in this direction. That is one reason why I am supporting Hillary Clinton for the presidency.
