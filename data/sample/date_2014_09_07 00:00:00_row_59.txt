This week, we lost Joan Rivers, who died on Thursday, at 81-years-young (as Sarah Silverman tweeted: "She wasn't done."). Rivers was a true trailblazer. Known now for the red carpet, she began with the glass ceiling, shattering it by telling-- and sometimes shouting -- unspoken truths. "A girl, you're 30-years-old, you're not married -- you're an old maid," she said, satirizing the prevalent culture. "A man, he's 90-years-old, he's not married -- he's a catch!" That was 1967 on the Ed Sullivan Show. "My act spoke to women who weren't able to talk about things," she said. "I was talking about things that were really true." And she never stopped. Through all her iterations, struggles, ups and downs, there was never anything fake about her -- except for her plastic-surgery-altered face, which, of course, she gleefully lampooned. Asked what she wanted on her tombstone, she replied: "She had a great time." As did we.
