Sunday Roundup
This week, Karl Rove suggested that Hillary Clinton might have suffered brain damage in 2012 when she was hospitalized after a fall that left her with a concussion. "Please assure Dr. Rove she's 100 percent," said a Clinton spokesman. Though Rove was obviously warming up his throat for the aria of sleaze that is sure to be sung in 2016, his talk of a candidate's health will hopefully open a wider debate -- though not the one Rove wants.  Washington is a town fueled by burnout and overwork, and we now know from science the negative impact that approach to life has on decision-making -- which is clearly the main skill a president needs. No one seriously doubts Clinton's brilliance, but the kind of lives we lead govern whether we have access to our wisdom and best judgment. Rove's provocation aside, the public would be well-served if questions about how candidates plan to avoid burnout become a legitimate part of our political conversation.
