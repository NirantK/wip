Sunday Roundup
This week, Hillary Clinton took on the war against voting. In a speech on Thursday, she called out governors Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Rick Perry, and Jeb Bush, demanding Republicans "stop fear mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud, and start explaining why they're so scared of letting citizens have their say." She followed it up with sensible proposals to make voting easier. Meanwhile, speaking of wars, on Monday Senator Lindsey Graham -- whose solution to every foreign policy problem boils down to armed conflict -- entered the 2016 race. Right on cue, three days later, responding to a question about the fact that Americans are tired of endless war, Graham said, "Well don't vote for me." Duly noted. It's an odd impulse to constantly want to start wars in the name of democracy while simultaneously undermining it here at home.
