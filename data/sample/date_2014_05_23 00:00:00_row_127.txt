Why I'm Supporting Marianne Williamson for U.S. Congress under the category:
POLITICS
I am a frontline witness to effects of the racist "War on Drugs" and the transformation of our prison system into a for-profit growth industry. I am grateful and emphatically supportive of congressional candidate Marianne Williamson for bringing the dark atrocity that has befallen our justice system into the light.
